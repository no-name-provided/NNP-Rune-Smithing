Metal runes are too heavy (and too poky) to wear around our necks, but they have proven durable enough to inlay into tools and armor."

With this technique, he has demonstrated a remarkable ability to visualize the area in which these arrays will have an effect, an ability I can only mimic with the careful application of sight runes."
